// You have been asked to manage a basketball league and are going to write a
// program to help you. Define two types. The first one, called Team, has a
// field for the name of the team and a field for the player names. The second
// type is called League and has a field called Teams for the teams in the
// league and a field called Wins that maps a teamâ€™s name to its number of
// wins.

// Add two methods to League. The first method is called MatchResult. It takes
// four parameters: the name of the first team, its score in the game, the
// name of the second team, and its score in the game. This method should
// update the Wins field in League. Add a second method to League called
// Ranking that returns a slice of the team names in order of wins. Build your
// data structures and call these methods from the main function in your
// program using some sample data.

// Define an interface called Ranker that has a single method called Ranking
// that returns a slice of strings. Write a function called RankPrinter with
// two parameters, the first of type Ranker and the second of type io.Writer.
// Use the io.WriteString function to write the values returned by Ranker to
// the io.Writer, with a newline separating each result. Call this function
// from main.
